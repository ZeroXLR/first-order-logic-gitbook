Natural, written languages obviously do not permit just any string of letters to be a sensible word. They are more discerning in that regard. Similarly, first order logic is also quite choosy in identifying the "official" and "unofficial" strings of its syntax.

Unlike natural languages, however, which identify their "official" words in complicated and almost unsystematic fashions, first order logic takes a relatively simple but systematic approach to define its set of acceptable "words" &mdash; the method of inductive definition.

In the next two chapters, I will progressively use this method to construct the "words" of first order logic &mdash; **formulas**. Of course, that this method works and produces a valid set of strings must be assumed outright in the metatheory.
